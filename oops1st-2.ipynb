    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1 Encapsulation: The idea of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (i.e., a class) and hiding the implementation details from the outside world. Encapsulation provides abstraction and makes the code more modular, maintainable, and secure.\n",
    "  2  Inheritance: The mechanism by which one class (i.e., the subclass or derived class) can inherit properties and behaviors from another class (i.e., the superclass or base class). Inheritance allows code reuse and promotes the idea of hierarchical classification and modeling.\n",
    "   3 Polymorphism: The ability of objects of different classes (or subclasses) to be used interchangeably in the same context, based on a common interface or behavior. Polymorphism allows for flexible and extensible code and supports the idea of generic programming and dynamic binding.\n",
    "   4 Abstraction: The process of identifying and extracting essential features or properties of a complex system and representing them in a simplified and generalized form. Abstraction helps to focus on the high-level design and functionality of a system and to avoid dealing with unnecessary details or implementation specifics."

    "Q3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "Ans...\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, the __init__() function is a special method that is called automatically when an object is created from a class. It is used to initialize the attributes of the object with default or provided values. The __init__() method is also known as a constructor method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of the __init__() method is to set the initial state of an object by assigning values to its attributes. Without this method, we would need to explicitly set the values of each attribute after creating an object, which can be cumbersome and error-prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",

    "print(person1.name, person1.age)  \n",
    "print(person2.name, person2.age)  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define a class called Person with an __init__() method that takes two parameters, name and age. The method initializes the name and age attributes of the object using the provided values. We then create two instances of the Person class, person1 and person2, with different names and ages. We can access the attributes of each object using the dot notation and print them out.\n",

    "Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "Ans..\n",
    " In object-oriented programming, self is a reference variable that refers to the current object (instance) of a class. It is used to access the attributes and methods of the object within the class definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a method is called on an object, the self parameter is automatically passed to the method by the interpreter. This allows the method to refer to the attributes and methods of the object using the self keyword, instead of directly referring to the object's name."

    "Q5. What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
    "Ans..\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows a new class to be based on an existing class, inheriting its properties (attributes and methods) and extending or modifying them as needed. The existing class is called the parent or base class, and the new class is called the child or derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four types of inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Single inheritance: When a child class inherits properties from a single parent class.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",

    "\n",
    "cat = Cat(\"Kitty\")\n",
    "print(cat.name)  \n",
    "cat.speak()\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define two classes, Animal and Cat, with Animal as the parent class and Cat as the child class. The Cat class inherits the name attribute from the Animal class using the super() function. The Cat class overrides the speak() method of the Animal class to print \"Meow\" when called.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Multilevel inheritance: When a child class inherits from a parent class, which itself inherits from another parent class.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",

    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",

    "print(cat.warm_blooded())  \n",
    "cat.speak()            \n",

    "In this example, we define three classes, Animal, Mamma, and Cat, with Animal as the base class, Mammal as the intermediate class, and Cat as the derived class. The Mamma class inherits from the Animal class and adds a warm_blooded() method. The Cat class inherits from the Mamma class and overrides the speak() method to print \"Meow\" when called.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Multiple inheritance: When a child class inherits properties from multiple parent classes.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Flyer:\n",
    "    def fly(self):\n",

    "duck = Duck()\n",
    "duck.fly()    \n",
    "duck.swim()   \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define three classes, Flyer, Swimmer, and Duck, with Flyer and Swimmer as the parent classes and Duck as the child class. The Duck class inherits from both Flyer and Swimmer classes, and it can access the fly() and swim() methods of both parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Hierarchical inheritance: When multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",

    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans...A database is a collection of data that is organized in a structured way to allow for efficient storage, retrieval, and management of information. Databases are commonly used in software applications, websites, and other digital systems to store and manage large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL are two different types of database management systems that use different approaches to store, manage and retrieve data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases, also known as relational databases, are based on a tabular structure, where data is organized into tables consisting of rows and columns. Each table represents a different entity or concept, and the relationships between tables are defined through the use of keys. SQL databases use a structured query language (SQL) to retrieve and manipulate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, use a non-tabular structure to store data. They can store data in different formats, such as key-value pairs, document-oriented, or graph databases. Unlike SQL databases, NoSQL databases don't use a predefined schema and don't require a fixed structure for data. Instead, they allow for more flexible data modeling and are often used for applications with large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",

    "Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "Ans..DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to define the structure and layout of the database. DDL commands are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, and views.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common DDL commands and their purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE: The CREATE command is used to create a new database object such as a table, index, or view. For example, the following SQL statement creates a new table named \"Customers\" with columns for name, address, and email:\n",
    "scss\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Customers (\n",
    "  Name varchar(255),\n",
    "  Address varchar(255),\n",
    "  Email varchar(255)\n",
    ");\n",
    "DROP: The DROP command is used to delete a database object. For example, the following SQL statement deletes the \"Customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE Customers;\n",
    "ALTER: The ALTER command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. For example, the following SQL statement adds a new column called \"Phone\" to the \"Customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE Customers\n",
    "ADD Phone varchar(255);\n",
    "TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE command is used to remove all data from a table, while keeping the table structure intact. For example, the following SQL statement removes all data from the \"Customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE Customers;\n",
    "In summary, DDL commands are used to define and modify the structure of a database. The CREATE command is used to create new database objects, the DROP command is used to delete objects, the ALTER command is used to modify objects, and the TRUNCATE command is used to remove all data from a table while keeping the structure intact."

    "Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example.\n",
    "Ans...DML stands for Data Manipulation Language, which is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to manipulate the data stored in a database. DML commands are used to insert, update, and delete data from tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common DML commands and their purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT: The INSERT command is used to add new rows of data to a table. For example, the following SQL statement inserts a new row into the \"Customers\" table:\n",

    "VALUES ('John Smith', '123 Main St', 'john.smith@example.com');\n",

    "UPDATE Customers\n",
    "SET Email = 'johnsmith@example.com'\n",
    "WHERE Name = 'John Smith';\n",

    "DQL stands for Data Query Language, which is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to query and retrieve data from a database. DQL commands are used to retrieve data from tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used DQL command is SELECT, which is used to retrieve data from one or more tables. The SELECT command allows you to specify the columns you want to retrieve and apply filters to the data.\n",

    "SELECT: This keyword specifies the columns you want to retrieve.\n",
    "FROM: This keyword specifies the table you want to retrieve data from.\n",
    "WHERE: This keyword allows you to apply filters to the data based on certain conditions.\n",
    "ORDER BY: This keyword allows you to sort the data by one or more columns.\n",
    "GROUP BY: This keyword allows you to group the data by one or more columns.\n",

    "Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "Ans\n",
    "Primary Key and Foreign Key are important concepts in database design and refer to the relationships between tables in a relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Key: A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. The primary key is used to enforce data integrity and ensure that each row in the table is unique. A primary key cannot contain null values and must be unique across all rows in the table. It can be a single column or a combination of columns.\n",
    "For example, in a Customers table, the CustomerID column can be used as the primary key to uniquely identify each customer. The primary key constraint is usually defined when the table is created using the CREATE TABLE statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key: A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. The foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables by linking them together. The foreign key constraint ensures that the data in the child table (the table with the foreign key) corresponds to the data in the parent table (the table with the primary key).\n",
    "For example, in an Orders table, the CustomerID column can be used as a foreign key to link the Orders table to the Customers table. This ensures that each order in the Orders table is associated with a customer in the Customers table. The foreign key constraint is usually defined when the table is created using the CREATE TABLE statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a primary key is used to uniquely identify each row in a table, while a foreign key is used to establish a relationship between two tables by linking them together based on the primary key of one table and the foreign key of another table.\n"
